# `hdeps` example

The <./hdeps/> directory was generated by calling `hdeps -i hdeps.json`.
The directory contains <./hdeps/overlay.nix>, which can be used to extend a Haskell package set in `nixpkgs` via an overlay (see <./flake.nix>).
In addition to `overlay.nix`, the directory contains a subdirectory per dependency listed in <./hdeps.json>.
